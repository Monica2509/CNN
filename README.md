# CNN
Transfer Learning using Python | Deep Learning | CNN A deep learning project demonstrating transfer learning for image classification. It utilizes pretrained models like VGG16, ResNet, or Inception for feature extraction, fine-tuning, and evaluation on a custom dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.
# 🧠 Transfer Learning using Python | Deep Learning | CNN

This project demonstrates how **Transfer Learning** can be used to build an efficient image classification model with limited training data.  
Using pretrained deep learning architectures such as **VGG16**, **ResNet50**, or **InceptionV3**, the notebook shows how to extract features, fine-tune layers, and evaluate model performance.
